# Corewar

 Final project of the algorithm branch, unlocking internship at 42 school.
 
# description

 Corewar is a virtual machine used as an arena for program battles. The project consist in compilation of programs into binaries, and execution of those binaries to let them fight. Those programs can then duplicate themselves, read and write in the arena, and overwrite other programs to stay the last survivor.
